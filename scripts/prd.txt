  - Accessibility compliance

## Technical Architecture
- **Framework and Tech Stack**:
  - Built on Jonghakseo Chrome Extension Boilerplate
  - React 19 for UI components
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Vite with Rollup for building
  - Turborepo for monorepo management

- **Extension Structure**:
  - Background script for data processing and storage
  - Content scripts for AliExpress data extraction
  - Popup interface for quick insights
  - Options page for detailed settings
  - New tab dashboard for comprehensive analytics
  
- **Data Management**:
  - Browser extension storage for user preferences
  - IndexedDB for order data persistence
  - Encrypted local storage for sensitive information
  - Optional data export/import functionality

- **Security**:
  - All data stored locally on user's device
  - No external server dependencies for core functionality
  - Optional encrypted sync between devices
  - Clear data privacy policy and controls

## Development Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)**
  - Basic order detection for AliExpress
  - Simple total spending calculation
  - Basic time filtering (this month, all time)
  - Minimal popup UI showing spend totals
  - Extension settings page

- **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
  - Improved metadata extraction
  - Basic categorization system
  - Simple budget setting and alerts
  - Enhanced UI with basic charts

- **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
