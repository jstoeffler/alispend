# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Data Storage Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the data storage system using IndexedDB for order data persistence, browser extension storage for user preferences, and encrypted local storage for sensitive information.
# Details:
1. Create a data model for AliExpress order information
2. Implement IndexedDB schema for storing order data
3. Create a storage service with CRUD operations for orders
4. Implement browser extension storage for user preferences
5. Add encryption for sensitive information
6. Create data migration utilities for schema updates
7. Implement data validation before storage
8. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for all CRUD operations. Test data persistence across browser sessions. Verify encryption and decryption of sensitive data. Test migration utilities with different schema versions. Implement stress tests with large datasets to ensure performance.
