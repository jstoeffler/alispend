# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Time-Based Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality for filtering expense data by different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom date range).
# Details:
1. Implement a data processing service in the background script
2. Create functions for calculating total spending across all orders
3. Implement currency normalization for international purchases
4. Add time-based filtering (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, custom)
5. Create data aggregation functions for different time periods
6. Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance
7. Add data validation and sanitization

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for all data processing functions. Test with mock order data covering various scenarios (different time periods, currencies, etc.). Verify time-based filtering with edge cases (month boundaries, leap years, etc.). Benchmark performance with large datasets.
