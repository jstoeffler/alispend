# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Cross-Browser Compatibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the extension works consistently across Chrome and Firefox browsers, handling browser-specific APIs and differences.
# Details:
1. Create a browser API abstraction layer
2. Implement browser detection
3. Handle Manifest V3 differences between Chrome and Firefox
4. Test and fix content script injection differences
5. Implement browser-specific storage adapters
6. Create separate build configurations for each browser
7. Implement feature detection and fallbacks

# Test Strategy:
Test the extension in both Chrome and Firefox browsers. Create automated tests using WebdriverIO for cross-browser testing. Verify that all features work consistently across browsers. Test browser-specific code paths. Verify that the abstraction layer correctly handles API differences. Test with different browser versions. Verify that the build process creates valid extensions for each browser.
