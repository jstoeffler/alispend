# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop AliExpress Order Detection Content Script
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create content scripts that detect and extract order details from AliExpress, including price, product details, date, and category information.
# Details:
1. Create content scripts that run on AliExpress domains
2. Implement detection logic for different AliExpress pages (order history, checkout, order details)
3. Create DOM parsers for each page type to extract order information
4. Implement event listeners for page navigation and DOM changes
5. Create a robust selector system that can handle minor website changes
6. Implement error handling for when selectors fail
7. Add logging for debugging purposes
8. Create a messaging system to communicate with the background script

# Test Strategy:
Create mock AliExpress pages with sample order data. Test the content scripts against these mocks to verify correct data extraction. Implement unit tests for each parser function. Manually test on actual AliExpress pages to ensure accurate detection and extraction.
