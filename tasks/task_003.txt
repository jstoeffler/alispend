# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop AliExpress Order Detection Content Script
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a highly modular content script system that detects and extracts order details from AliExpress, with support for different languages, page structures, and frequent website updates.
# Details:
1. Design a modular architecture for the AliExpress crawler
   - Create separate modules for different page types (order history, checkout, order details)
   - Implement a plugin system for different scraping strategies
   - Develop an abstraction layer to isolate DOM interaction logic

2. Implement language and region-specific adaptations
   - Create language detection mechanism
   - Design selectors that work across different language versions
   - Store language-specific selector patterns in configuration files

3. Develop robust selector strategies
   - Implement multiple fallback selector mechanisms (CSS, XPath, text-based)
   - Create selector versioning system for different AliExpress layouts
   - Add automatic selector testing and validation

4. Build comprehensive testing infrastructure
   - Create a repository of sample AliExpress pages in assets/order-pages/
   - Implement automated tests against these sample pages
   - Design a visual testing tool for debugging selector failures
   - Add regression testing to prevent breaking changes

5. Create version detection and update mechanism
   - Add detection for AliExpress site version changes
   - Implement remote configuration updates for selectors
   - Create monitoring system to detect website structure changes

6. Implement error handling and diagnostics
   - Add detailed logging for scraping attempts
   - Create self-healing mechanisms for broken selectors
   - Implement graceful degradation when full extraction isn't possible

7. Add data normalization and validation
   - Create validators for extracted data
   - Implement data cleaning and transformation
   - Add mechanisms to handle incomplete data

# Test Strategy:
Create a comprehensive test suite with:
1. Unit tests for each scraper module using JSDOM
2. Integration tests against sample HTML pages stored in assets/order-pages/
3. Visual regression tests to detect selector failures
4. Snapshot testing for data extraction consistency
5. End-to-end tests with mocked AliExpress pages
6. Manual testing on actual AliExpress pages for verification
7. Continuous testing against different languages and regions
